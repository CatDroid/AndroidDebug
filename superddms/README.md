# superddms

Google Android's DDMS stands for "Dalvik Debug Monitor", one of the most useful tools.
Here I'd like to add jdb debug feature for it. 
My Goals:
1.Add useful ability like ScreenCapture, DumpView, SystemTrace, OpenGLTrace for it
2.Add jdb debug feature, and anyone can use it as an android debug tool!
3.In the meantime I will extend the ability of jdb, add some more exciting feature like bytecode debug

Until the time I write this, there is still no handy tools for android-java debug
